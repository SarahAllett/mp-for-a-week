			<text>[open] Mr Speaker&#46; It is a difficult task to find a way of protecting our planet for the future&#44; while maintaining a prosperous economy today&#46; The Government&#39;s plans in the Green Transport Bill do a pretty good job of this&#46;</text>

		<clip mp3Filename="fuel_speech201-03.mp3" jpgFilename="speech-01.jpg" clipType="main" points="0">
			<text>[middle] Let&#39;s be keen&#44; keen to be green&#46; Support the tax on gasoline&#33;</text>
		</clip>
		<clip mp3Filename="fuel_speech201-18.mp3" jpgFilename="speech-01.jpg" clipType="main" points="1">
			<text>[middle] The big problem with this plan is this &#45; it will make little difference&#46; People might buy a few more electric cars but this plan won&#39;t tackle climate change as the Government is saying&#46;</text>
		</clip>
		<clip mp3Filename="fuel_speech201-05.mp3" jpgFilename="speech-01.jpg" clipType="main" points="-1">
			<text>[middle] I like the Government&#39;s plan&#46; Our country is on the move&#46; We&#39;re moving from over&#45;dependence on fossil fuels like oil&#44; toward energy independence&#46;</text>
		</clip>
		<clip mp3Filename="fuel_speech201-19.mp3" jpgFilename="speech-01.jpg" clipType="main" points="1">
			<text>[middle] The Government needs to think&#44; how will this tax affect UK business&#63; If a similar tax increase is not made in other countries&#44; then it shouldn&#39;t be made here&#46; Do we really want to damage our economy&#63;</text>
		</clip>
		<clip mp3Filename="fuel_speech201-06.mp3" jpgFilename="speech-01.jpg" clipType="main" points="-1">
			<text>[middle] Opponents say this plan to move the country to &#39;greener transport&#39; will not make a big enough difference&#46; I see what they&#39;re saying&#44; but I think as long as it is part of a larger plan&#44; it is worthwhile&#46;</text>
		</clip>
		<clip mp3Filename="fuel_speech201-20.mp3" jpgFilename="speech-01.jpg" clipType="main" points="1">
			<text>[middle] To be blunt &#45; this tax will have negative consequences&#46; The price of food&#44; services and household goods will rise&#46; It will cause massive inflation&#46;</text>
		</clip>
		<clip mp3Filename="fuel_speech201-08.mp3" jpgFilename="speech-01.jpg" clipType="main" points="-2">
			<text>[middle] I will be supporting the Green Transport Bill&#44; but could I also urge the Government to help UK businesses adapt to an economy where fuel is more expensive&#63;</text>
		</clip>
		<clip mp3Filename="fuel_speech201-12.mp3" jpgFilename="speech-01.jpg" clipType="main" points="-1">
			<text>[middle] This plan will move us toward a greener economy&#46; It will encourage research into more efficient vehicles&#44; a field in which Britain is already a world leader&#46;</text>
		</clip>
		<clip mp3Filename="fuel_speech201-28.mp3" jpgFilename="speech-01.jpg" clipType="main" points="2">
			<text>[middle] I don&#39;t believe we have the people&#39;s support on this&#46; There is a clear danger for the Government and the governing party&#46; Raise this fuel tax &#45; don&#39;t get re&#45;elected at the next election&#46;</text>
		</clip>
		<clip mp3Filename="fuel_speech201-14.mp3" jpgFilename="speech-01.jpg" clipType="end" points="-1">
			<text>[close] And so I think the Government&#39;s plan strikes a good balance between our needs today and the planet&#39;s future&#46; We should support this Bill&#46;</text>

		<clip mp3Filename="fuel_speech201-15.mp3" jpgFilename="speech-01.jpg" clipType="end" points="0">
			<text>[close] And Mr Speaker&#44; in closing&#44; could I make one final request of the honourable members here present&#44; could I ask&#46;&#46;&#46; has anyone seen my watch&#63; I last had it in the Members&#39; Lobby&#46; I took it off to wind it and I think I left it on the side&#46;</text>

			<text>[open] Mr Speaker&#46; I welcome the Government trying to protect the environment&#46; We need urgent action to tackle climate change&#46; But there are lots of problems with this plan&#46;</text>

			<text>[close] I agree with Government&#39;s aims to help the environment&#46; However&#44; I don&#39;t agree with how they&#39;ve chosen to go about it&#46; The Green Transport Bill will leave the country in the red&#46;</text>
